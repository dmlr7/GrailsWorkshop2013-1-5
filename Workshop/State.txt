    2:Answer the following questions: DONE
        ● What  is  the  H2  database  console?  What  risks  does  it  represents?
          What would you as a developer do to prevent those risks?
        ● When do you set up the database and the tables to use on your application?
        ● In  Grails,  how  it  is  replaced  the  XML  configuration  in  your  application?
          Give  two  motives why Grails solution improves the previous one.
        ● What is a domain instance? When does Grails validates a domain instance?
        ● When using scaffolding, is it possible to modify views or logic of a given domain class?
          If  the   answer  is yes, explain how can you do that,
          but if the answer is  no, give one reason why this is not allowed.
        ● What  can  you  do  in  order  to  have  a   set  of  data  in  the Grails  database  
          to  persist  along several executions of the project, while in development?
        ● What  are  the differences between using findAll(), getAll() and list() and when it’s useful or
          not to use each of them for finding all of domain class instances?
        ● What is the difference between using p.save()  and p.save(flush:true, failOnError:true)
